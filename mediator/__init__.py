Mediator: Profuderâ€™s rebranded popular TV API.

This module defines the Mediator package, which provides an API for accessing and managing movies and TV shows. The
package includes several modules and classes that implement the API functionality, as well as utility functions and
constants that are used throughout the package.

The main API classes and functions are exported at the package level, so they can be easily accessed by other modules
or applications that use the package.

For more information on how to use and contribute to the package, see the project
repository at https://github.com/bastiensoucasse/mediator.
